# This is my personal blog based on Docsify

## Why I want to build a Blog

- Record Study

    I used to write note on OneNote, which is can't export in md file, so i decide to write notes in markdown file, and improve the skill of writing learning notes.

- Share My Knowledge

    Don't dare to share what you have learnt cuz you think you are not good at it.

- I will implement this when I come up with other ideas

## What will be in my blog

- my learning process of new techs

  - Linux learning (Plan position 1)

  - docker

  - coming

- my thoughts/experience

  - what ever i want to write 

## Any way I'm working hard to improve and continuously updating this blog
